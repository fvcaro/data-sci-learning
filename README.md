# Data Science Learning

Welcome to the Data Science Learning repository! This repository contains my initial explorations in data science using scikit-learn.

## Installing Miniconda3

Follow these steps to install Miniconda3 on macOS:

1. Create a directory for Miniconda3:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
2. Download the Miniconda3 installation script: 
   ```sh
   curl -L https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh -o ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
3. Run the installation script:
   ```sh
   bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
4. Remove the installation script:
   ```sh
   rm ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
5. Initialize Miniconda3 with your shell:
   ```sh
   ~/miniconda3/bin/conda init zsh
6. Reload the shell configuration:
   ```sh
   source ~/.zshrc

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Follow these simple steps:

1. Visit the [scikit-learn website](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) to familiarize yourself with the framework if you haven't already.
2. Ensure that Python (preferably a version that scikit-learn supports) is installed on your system.
3. Install scikit-learn using pip, which is a package manager for Python. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
4. Optionally, you can create a virtual environment to keep the dependencies required by the project separate from your global Python environment:
